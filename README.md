# Home_Sales_SPARKSQL

This project is the 22nd weekly challenge for the Data Analytics Bootcamp by EdX hosted by The University of Oregon. This project demonstrated the use of Spark to create SQL commands in a Google Colab python environment. It uses this to create temporary views of tables, partition the data using parquet, and cache and uncache the temporary tables.
